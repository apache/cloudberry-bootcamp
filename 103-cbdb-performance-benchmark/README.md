# CloudberryDB Performance Benchmark

This tutorial will show you how to perform a CloudberryDB performance benchmark in the CloudberryDB Sandbox Docker image. The benchmark process consists of two parts:

- [Part 1: TPC-H benchmark](../103-cbdb-performance-benchmark/tpch.md)
- [Part 2: TPC-DS benchmark](../103-cbdb-performance-benchmark/tpcds.md)

These benchmarks are designed to simulate real-world scenarios and measure the performance of decision support systems under various conditions.

By completing this tutorial, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of CloudberryDB's performance capabilities and how to effectively benchmark its performance using industry-standard tools and techniques.
